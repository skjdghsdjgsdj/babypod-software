# Example settings.toml; modify it as needed for your specific BabyPod, then save it directly
# to the CIRCUITPY drive as settings.toml.

# This file contains secrets so never put it in version control.
# Keep strings in double quotes and ints unquoted.

# Generic documentation for settings.toml:
# https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/environment.html

# Do NOT define CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID nor CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD, but instead use the settings
# below. You do not want the BabyPod to connect automatically to Wi-Fi, and CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID and
# CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD will do so before code.py starts.

# Required settings in all cases:

# Your Wi-Fi's SSID (network name)
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID_DEFER=""
# Your Wi-Fi's password
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD_DEFER=""
# Baby Buddy's API endpoint URL including trailing slash, like http://10.1.2.3/api/
BABYBUDDY_BASE_URL="https://.../api/"
# Baby Buddy's API user's authorization token: https://docs.baby-buddy.net/api/#authentication
BABYBUDDY_AUTH_TOKEN=""
# Increase the CircuitPython stack size; must be a multiple of 4 and larger than the default of
# 1536. Try 1600. If you still get "pystack exhausted" errors, nudge this up slowly.
CIRCUITPY_PYSTACK_SIZE=1600
# Must be 1 if your BabyPod does NOT have a physical power switch wired across EN and GND. Set to 1 to press the Center
# button to wake the BabyPod and press and hold to turn it off. Depending on user options it will also sleep
# automatically after inactivity, starting certain timers, etc. Set to 0 to always keep the BabyPod on and rely on an
# external physical power switch to manage power.
USE_SOFT_POWER_CONTROL=1

# Required settings if your BabyPod has an RTC:

# Your adafruit.io API user's username: https://io.adafruit.com/api/docs/#authentication
ADAFRUIT_AIO_USERNAME=""
# Your adafruit.io API user's key
ADAFRUIT_AIO_KEY=""

# Optional settings

# The channel number of your Wi-Fi access point. If you only have one and you set the
# channel number here, Wi-Fi connections are faster. If you have multiple Wi-Fi access points on
# different channels, or you're just not sure, leave this at 0 and the strongest channel will be
# autoselected at the expense of a slower startup.
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_INITIAL_CHANNEL=0 # defaults to 0
# Wi-Fi connection timeout in seconds, both for connecting to the access point and for
# HTTP requests in general.
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_TIMEOUT=10 # defaults to 10
# Device name as it should appear in some notes posted to the API; defaults to "BabyPod"
DEVICE_NAME="" # defaults to "BabyPod"
